# Clinic-Trial-Dataset-SQL-Question-and-Answer-Project
Hello everyone!
I’m excited to share my project on the Clinic Trial Dataset, where I’ve delved into clinical data using SQL queries. In this project, I’ve answered common questions related to age, clinical trials, patient demographics, treatments, drug reaction and it outcomes.

Project Overview:
Dataset: The Clinic Trial Dataset contains information about patients, treatments, drug reaction, and medical outcomes.

Objective: My goal was to extract meaningful outcomes from this dataset using SQL queries.

I answered questions such as:
“Identify ladies whose BP was between 100 and 120?”
“Select ladies whose name ends with ‘i’?”
“Find average blood pressure of those had drug reaction and did not had drug reaction?”
“Identify ladies who had low anxiety aged less than 30?”
etc.

Repository Contents:
SQL Queries: You’ll find a set of SQL scripts that I used to analyze the dataset.
Results: I’ve included both raw questions pdf and sql Answers script.
README: This document provides an overview of the project, instructions to know about the script.
Feel free to explore the repository, run the queries, and share your feedback! 🚀
